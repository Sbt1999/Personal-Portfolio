        HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, allows web users to create and structure sections, paragraphs, and links using elements, tags, and attributes. However, it’s worth noting that HTML is not considered a programming language as it can’t create dynamic functionality.

        HTML has a lot of use cases, namely:

        Web development. Developers use HTML code to design how a browser displays web page elements, such as text, hyperlinks, and media files. 
        Internet navigation. Users can easily navigate and insert links between related pages and websites as HTML is heavily used to embed hyperlinks. 
        Web documentation. HTML makes it possible to organize and format documents, similarly to Microsoft Word.
